### L-System 1: "Garden"
This L-System is a modification of the [Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) with slightly curved angles.
Below are iterations for $n=1$ through $n=6$ (as the curve does not become visually interesting until higher $n$).

### L-System 2: "Tile"
This L-System is inspired by the [$n$-flake fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-flake) and uses as its base a hexagon.
Below are iterations for $n=1$ through $n=4$.

### L-System 3: "Maze"
This L-System is also based on the Hilbert curve and uses the "node-replacing" technique to generate a [FASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve) on a 4-by-4 starting grid.
Unfortunately, the curve is not fully self-avoiding or space-filling for reasons I don't fully understand.

### Probabilistic L-System: "Plant"
This L-System uses a combination of probabilistic rule-following and probabilistic length and angle parameters.
At each iteration, the plant either grows the stem, a pair of leaves, or a "berry."
The angle of the leaves and the length of the stem can be random as well.
