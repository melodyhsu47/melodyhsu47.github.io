### Code
Find the Processing code for polar curves [here](https://github.com/melodyhsu47/CompFab-2025/blob/main/polar.pde), and for the Sierpinski carpet [here](https://github.com/melodyhsu47/CompFab-2025/blob/main/sierpinski.pde). Find the code for a third design, which was based on the classic Windows "pipes screensaver," [here](https://1j01.github.io/pipes/). (This design was not fabricated.) 

#### Polar curves
The code for the polar curves is based on two polar curves, one called "Splat" and one called "Flower."
The flower is generated by the equation $$r=\left(1.5+\cos(\frac{19\theta}{2})^3\right)\cdot\rho$$, and the splat is generated by the equation $$r=\left(2+\cos(\frac{19\theta}{2})^2\right)\cdot\rho$$, where $\rho$ is some scaling factor which determines the overall size of the curve.
