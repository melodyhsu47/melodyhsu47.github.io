My name is Melody Hsu and I'm a second-year PhD student in the University of Colorado, Boulder Computer Science department. I work on problems in algorithmic game theory and have broader interests in algorithmic economics, computational social choice, and the ethics of using algorithms as a solution to solving societal inequities.
